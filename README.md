# zlfft

zlfft aims at FFT implementation and analysis.

## Usage

Please make sure `Clang` (`AppleClang 16+` or `LLVM/Clang 17+`), `cmake` (minimum 3.20) are installed and configured on your OS.

You may need to edit the building commands in `benchmark/build_config.py`.

### Accuracy Benchmark

```console
python3 benchmark/accuracy.py <n0> <n1> <algorithm>
```

Run the algorithm forward method and compares the result with a naive Stockham implementation, from order `n0` to `n1`.

Example:

```console
python3 benchmark/accuracy.py 5 20 naive_cooley_radix2
...
Running accuracy benchmark for naive_cooley_radix2 from order 16 to 20...
Order      MSE               
----------------------------
16         1.03460500e-09    
17         2.25209500e-09    
18         4.90519100e-09    
19         1.06781200e-08    
20         2.29328400e-08 
```

### Throughput Benchmark

```console
python3 benchmark/throughput.py <n0> <n1> <algorithm>
```

Run the algorithm forward method and calculates the throughput, from order `n0` to `n1`.

Example:

```console
python3 benchmark/throughput.py 16 20 naive_cooley_radix2
...
Running throughput benchmark for naive_cooley_radix2 from order 16 to 20...
Order      Time (us)       Throughput (MFLOPS) 
---------------------------------------------
16         1550.5708       3381.2580           
17         3222.9900       3456.7653           
18         7010.0217       3365.6044           
19         13948.0256      3570.9255           
20         25840.5833      4057.8651    
```
